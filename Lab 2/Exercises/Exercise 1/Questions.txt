1. Successor nodes are inserted at front of the fringe (successor list) as a node is expanded. Is this a breadth (FIFO) or depth-first search (LIFO)?

depth-first search (LIFO)

2. For goal J, give the fringe (successor list) after expanding each node

fringe: [State: B - Depth: 1, State: C - Depth: 1]
fringe: [State: D - Depth: 2, State: E - Depth: 2, State: C - Depth: 1]
fringe: [State: E - Depth: 2, State: C - Depth: 1]
fringe: [State: C - Depth: 1]
fringe: [State: F - Depth: 2, State: G - Depth: 2]
fringe: [State: G - Depth: 2]
fringe: [State: H - Depth: 3, State: I - Depth: 3, State: J - Depth: 3]
fringe: [State: I - Depth: 3, State: J - Depth: 3]
fringe: [State: J - Depth: 3]

3. What is the effect of inserting successor nodes at the end of the fringe as a node is expanded? A depth or breadth-first search?

It searches all nodes in the same depth first. Breadth-first search

4. For goal J, give the fringe (successor list) after expanding each node

fringe: [State: B - Depth: 1, State: C - Depth: 1]
fringe: [State: C - Depth: 1, State: D - Depth: 2, State: E - Depth: 2]
fringe: [State: D - Depth: 2, State: E - Depth: 2, State: F - Depth: 2, State: G - Depth: 2]
fringe: [State: E - Depth: 2, State: F - Depth: 2, State: G - Depth: 2]
fringe: [State: F - Depth: 2, State: G - Depth: 2]
fringe: [State: G - Depth: 2]
fringe: [State: H - Depth: 3, State: I - Depth: 3, State: J - Depth: 3]
fringe: [State: I - Depth: 3, State: J - Depth: 3]
fringe: [State: J - Depth: 3]
