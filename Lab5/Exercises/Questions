1.What is the branching factor at depth 0? At depth 1?
branching factor = 9 at depth 0
branching factor = 8 at depth 1

2.What is the maximal depth?
maximal depth = 9

3.Will a MIN move attempt to minimize or maximize the utility?
minimize

4.Are states after a terminal state explored?
no

5.Are all possible states explored to a terminal state?
yes

6.Is this a depth-first or breadth-first search? How do you know? (see Python code)
depth first. The algorithm finds deepest value and then goes up
